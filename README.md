## Overview of the analysis

In this project we are organizing our data and presenting in HTML. By organizing, formatting and adding filters to the data, the page makes user-friendly interface and easy track data. 

## Results

Using JavaScript code, HTML page was created, decorated, and added features to filter the data. As one can see from the below image, the page was created with layouts and images. Filters were added so that users can enter in date, city, state, country and shape.

## Summary

The page has unique features to filter out information by date, city, state, country, and shape. This format of HTML can be used for more lengthy data. However, if the user is searching by the shape, the person needs to know exactly what they are searching for. 

To eliminate these issues, we can add dropdown selections on each filter so that the user knows the limitation of each selection. 

Also, adding a reset button after the filter selection can also help users to clear out the information and tell them that they can re-search by next filters. For example, most of the locations are in the US. But there is a couple of data that shows the location in Canada. If user filters out information by country, reset button can reset the input of filters for next search.
